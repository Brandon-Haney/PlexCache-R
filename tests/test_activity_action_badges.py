"""Recent Activity action badges and filter pills.

Two defects these lock down:

* `Moved` and `Released` had no arm in `action_badge`, so both fell through to
  the muted default and were styled like an unrecognised action. `Moved` is the
  main restore-by-copy path and `Released` is a deliberate, user-visible state.
* The "Moved" pill sent ``data-filter="Moved to Array"`` — the label maintenance
  writes — so it matched no entry from an actual run, and those rows landed
  under "Other" instead. The hardcoded ``KNOWN_ACTIONS`` also named `Protected`,
  which has no pill, so those rows matched neither their own filter nor "Other"
  and were reachable only under "All".

Source-text tests: this is template + inline JS with no Python seam, and the
contract that matters is "every action a writer emits is handled".
